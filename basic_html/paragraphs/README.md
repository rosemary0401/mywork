# Explain
* Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
* paragraph element: `<p></p>` & `<pre></pre>`
* `<p>` will ignore lines and spaces between texts.
* `<pre>` defines preformatted text and preserve both spaces and line breaks typed within `<pre>` element.
