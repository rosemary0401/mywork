# Explain
* `style` has 3 ways to show CSS:
  - inline style: style is an attribute in HTML elements
  - external: an external CSS file
  - internal: style element(tag)
* Consider `style` as an attribute with property & value and put them into other HTML elements needed to be changed
* The syntax is like <`HTML-element` `style`=`"property:value;"`>
  - property & value are about CSS such as color, font-size, font-family, text-align etc
