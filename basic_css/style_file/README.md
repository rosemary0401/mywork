# Explain
* `style` has 3 ways to show CSS:
  - inline style: style is an attribute in each HTML element
  - external: an external CSS file
  - internal: style element(tag) in `<head></head>` section
* Create a new style.css file independent of original html file and save both files in the same folder
* Write css code in style.css file and must not contain any HTML code
  - The syntax is written the same way as written by using internal style
  - `HTML element { proverty:value ; }`
* Write `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` in `<head></head>` section
